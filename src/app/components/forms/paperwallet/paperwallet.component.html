        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <strong>Step 1. Generate New Address</strong><br>
        <p>Click on the "Generate New Address" button.<br>
        </p><br>
        <strong>Step 2. Print the Paper Wallet</strong><br>
        <p>Print the page using the high quality setting. Never save the page as a PDF file to print it later since a file is more likely to be hacked than a piece of paper.<br>
        </p><br>
        <strong>Step 3. Share your public address</strong><br>
        <p>Use your public address to receive CasinoCoin from other users. You can share your public address as much as you want.<br>
        </p><br>
        <strong>Step 4. Keep your private key secret</strong><br>
        <p>The private key is literally the keys to your coins. If someone were to obtain it, they could withdraw the funds currently in the wallet, and any funds that might be deposited in that wallet.<br>
        </p><br>
        <p>Please test sending a small amount before receiving any large payments. You can check the balance of your wallet using your public address here: https://explorer.casinocoin.org/<br></p>
